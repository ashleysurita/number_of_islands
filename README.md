```Q. Given a 2D array of integers representing water (by 0) and land (by 1), count the number of islands. Any lands connected to each other are considered one island.

Examples:
Given a grid:
     [   [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
         [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
         [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   ]
// returns 1

Given a grid:
     [   [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
         [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
         [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]   ]
